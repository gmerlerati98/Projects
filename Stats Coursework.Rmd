This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Question 1}

max_turns <- 50 # How many turns a player can take before it breaks the loop.

position <- 0 # Starting position
max_position <- 100 # The 'end' game point where the player cant progress any further
n_sides_die <- 6 # maximum number of position you can travel during one turn

for(turn in 1:max_turns ) {# for loop used to iterate over the vector that was created earlier with the max_turns variable.
  die_roll <- sample.int(n_sides_die, 1)  # assigning the function to the die roll variable. sample.int function used for an integer vector of length size with elements from 1:n, in this case 1:6.
  position <- position + die_roll # adds a variable to the position of the player by assigning it the value of the die roll plus the current position of the player.
 if ( position >= max_position ) # if the player reaches 60 which is the max turns, the for loop ends.
    break # terminates the statement set up by the for loop earlier and the loop is terminated
